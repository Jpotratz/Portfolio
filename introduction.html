        <p> Hello! Welcome to my online portfolio! </p>
        <p> This website is designed to inform you of who I am professionally, as well as personally.</p>
        <p> You may find information regarding my professional career under the
          <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> and <a href="prog.html">Programming</a> tabs. </p>
        <p> You can find information about my personal hobbies under the <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> tab.</p>

        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I am currently a full-time student at Metropolitan Community College, as well as a full-time intern at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. I am currently pursuing a computer science degree to acquire a job in the Development field.
          The internship at the NAIC is helpful as it is allowing me to gain experience in the corporate technology environment.</p>
        <p> I attended Iowa State University for roughly a year and a half from 2012-2013, where I decided to take a pause in my education and pursue a full time job. For close to four years I worked at several casinos as a Pit Boss in the table games department.
          Eventually I realized I wanted to pursue my personal interests as a career and decided to go back to school. Since 2017 I have been attending Metropolitan Community College to finish a degree and pursue a career in Computer Development.</p>
        <p>This website is part of my education at MCC, to create a web site for my Web Development course. I realized this is a great oppurtunity to just create an online portfolio for my professional career. Two birds with one stone so to speak.
          This will serve as a basis for a portfolio that will actually be used in a professional setting down the road.</p>
