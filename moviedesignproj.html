        <p> As a side hobby for personal knowledge I like to do short video editing.
           Most of the techniques I have used are self taught, and through trial and error.
            The inspiration for my work started when I first participated in an event in a video game called "World of Warcraft".
            Another player made a montage of sorts that was very epic and inspiring regarding our gameplay.
          This inspiring video shown below propelled my hobby. </p>

        <p> I have been practicing video editing off and on since around 2012.
           I originally worked with Sony Vegas 12, and migrated over to Adobe Premiere recently.
           I would have to say I prefer Premiere, it is a much more user friendly and modern program. </p>
        <p> My most recent video using the skills I have learned is below. </p>
